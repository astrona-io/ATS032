# Teaching and assessment review

The course has teaching material for its registered lab tasks, but its readings cover a broader set of skills than its graders. Passing all environment tests proves the implemented lifecycles; it does not establish complete practical coverage of every learning objective.

`TEACHING-COVERAGE.yaml` names the preparation set for every lab. `LAB-COVERAGE.md` renders both directions: lab to preparation and reading to assessment. A preparation link means the reading teaches something used by that task, not that every operation in the reading is graded. The additional-reading list makes material without a module assessment visible. Capstones combine selected skills and do not silently count as coverage of every reading.

## Remaining practical gaps and boundaries

- The maintenance labs assess disruption budgets, scheduling, inventory and service recovery. They do not install a Kubernetes or operating-system upgrade or perform an etcd restore.
- The token lab assesses projected-token configuration and effective RBAC. Audience rejection is taught as a separate experiment; it is not a scored outcome.
- Admission webhook failure behavior and aggregated ClusterRole construction have playground examples but no dedicated module grader.

These are explicit limits, not completed assessments. When closing one, add or extend a runnable environment, teach the actual commands and evidence, add a live grader with negative cases, and update the mapping. Do not mark a reference procedure as practiced just because it contains a command block.

## Runtime choice

Use kind for Kubernetes API objects, admission, scheduling and network tests whose required controllers or network plugin are installed. Use QEMU for an independent Linux kernel, host service lifecycle, mandatory access control or kernel event collection. A runtime name or ConfigMap is never proof that its intended runtime or encryption mechanism is active.

Keep each new lab immediately after its preparation reading. Preserve the existing PR for this repository, push separate commits, and leave merging to the reviewer.
