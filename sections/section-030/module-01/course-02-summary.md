- Restrict access to Kubernetes API

# Summary

The API server checks caller identity, requested permission and relevant admission policy before storing a change. Transport verification and endpoint restrictions protect the access path while narrow grants limit accepted authority.

Datastore access, admission dependencies and audit retention have their own trust and availability requirements. A compromised authorized credential can misuse legitimate API operations, so detection and recovery must account for the actions its grants permit.

API protection combines independent boundaries rather than relying on one restrictive role or firewall rule.
